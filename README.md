# ShareLock

[**简体中文版本**](./README-zh.md)

A cryptographically secure, decentralized-trust file storage and sharing system designed to operate safely over untrusted cloud infrastructure.

**ShareLock** extends the core architectural principles of the UC Berkeley CS161 security framework into an end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) file sharing application. It guarantees confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity for all user data, even in the event of a total server-side compromise.

---

## Threat Model & Security Guarantees

The system is engineered against an **Active Malicious Adversary** who has full control over the storage server (Datastore) and network traffic.

### Security Goals

- **Confidentiality:** Unauthorized users (including the storage provider) learn absolutely nothing about file contents, file lengths, filenames, or the sharing graph topology.
- **Integrity & Authenticity:** Any unauthorized modification, tampering, or rollback of file data or sharing metadata by the server or an attacker is instantly detected.
- **Revocation Efficiency:** When a file owner revokes access from a user, that user immediately loses access to all future updates of the file, and their cryptographic access paths are completely invalidated.

---

## Architecture & Cryptographic Design

The application implements a layered cryptographic pipeline to ensure zero-knowledge storage and secure access delegation.

### 1. Cryptographic Primitives

| Primitive | Algorithm | Usage |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Symmetric Encryption | AES-CTR (128-bit) | Authenticated encryption of file chunks, file metadata, and user structs |
| Message Authentication | HMAC-SHA512 | Integrity verification (encrypt-then-MAC) |
| Public-Key Encryption | RSA-OAEP (2048-bit) with SHA-512 | Secure key exchange for sharing invitations |
| Digital Signatures | RSA-PKCS1.5 (2048-bit) with SHA-512 | Non-repudiation and verification of sharing invites |
| Key Derivation | Argon2id | Master key derivation from user password |
| Key Diversification | HashKDF (HMAC-based) | Deriving purpose-specific sub-keys (encryption vs. MAC) from a single master key |
| Hashing | SHA-512 | Deterministic UUID generation, filename salting |

### 2. Key Hierarchy

```
User Password
    └── Argon2id (salted by username)
            └── MasterKey
                    ├── HashKDF(..., "enc")      → Encryption Key  (AES-CTR)
                    ├── HashKDF(..., "mac")      → MAC Key         (HMAC-SHA512)
                    ├── HashKDF(..., filename)   → Personal Key
                    │       ├── HashKDF(..., "personal_enc") → Personal Encryption Key
                    │       └── HashKDF(..., "personal_mac") → Personal MAC Key
                    └── (RSA keypair, DS keypair)
```

### 3. Data Structures

- **File Blocking:** Files are split into 512-byte `FileBlock` chunks, each encrypted independently with a file-specific key derived from a random `FileKey`.
- **Inode:** Tracks total file size and an ordered list of block UUIDs. Encrypted and MAC'd as a single blob under the file key.
- **MailboxNode:** Per-user pointer containing `FileKey` and `InodeUUID`, encrypted with a mailbox-specific key. Each user (owner or sharee) has their own MailboxNode.
- **Access Record:** Maps a filename to the owner's MailboxNode UUID/key and maintains a sharing tree (`Chidren` map) of all direct sharees for revocation.
- **Invitation:** Encrypted payload containing a `MailboxUUID` and `MailboxKey`, transmitted via RSA-OAEP + digital signature to grant access.
- **User Struct:** Contains the username, RSA private key, DS signing key, Argon2-derived master key, and a map of known file access pointers. Encrypted under user's derived keys and stored in the Datastore.

### 4. Cryptographic Flow

```
StoreFile:
  content → ByteToBlock (512B chunks)
          → encryptAndMAC(block, fEncKey, fMacKey) for each block
          → Inode{Size, BlockUUIDs} → encryptAndMAC → DatastoreSet
          → MailboxNode{FileKey, InodeUUID} → encryptAndMAC(mailbox keys) → DatastoreSet
          → Access{MymailboxUUID, MymailboxKey} → encryptAndMAC(personal keys) → DatastoreSet

LoadFile:
  Access UUID → DatastoreGet → decryptAndVerify(personal keys)
             → Access{MymailboxUUID, MymailboxKey}
             → MailboxNode → DatastoreGet → decryptAndVerify(mailbox keys)
             → MailboxNode{FileKey, InodeUUID}
             → Inode → DatastoreGet → decryptAndVerify(file keys)
             → Blocks → DatastoreGet → decryptAndVerify(file keys)
             → BlockYToByte → content

AppendToFile:
  Same as StoreFile block creation, but appends to existing inode's BlockUUIDs
  and updates Size. Does not re-encrypt existing blocks.

CreateInvitation:
  → Decrypt own MailboxNode
  → Create new MailboxNode for recipient (same FileKey/InodeUUID)
  → Encrypt invitation (RSA-OAEP) + sign (RSA-PKCS1.5)
  → Update sender's Access.Chidren

AcceptInvitation:
  → Verify signature + decrypt invitation (RSA-OAEP)
  → Create local Access pointing to received MailboxNode

RevokeAccess:
  → Generate new FileKey
  → Re-encrypt all blocks and inode with new key
  → Create new owner MailboxNode
  → Update remaining children's MailboxNodes with new FileKey
  → Remove revoked user from Chidren
```

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** All encryption/decryption occurs strictly client-side. Keys never leave the local device in plaintext.
- **Granular Access Control:** Seamlessly share files with specific users via encrypted invitation pointers backed by the MailboxNode sharing tree.
- **Instant Revocation:** Dynamic re-keying mechanism rotates the file key on revocation, isolates revoked users, and transparently updates remaining sharees without breaking their access.
- **Append Optimization:** Append to existing large files without downloading or re-encrypting the entire file structure.
- **Encrypt-Then-MAC:** All ciphertexts are authenticated with HMAC-SHA512 before storage, guaranteeing integrity.
- **TLS-Encrypted Streaming:** The `read` command downloads files over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection via the `netstream` module, ensuring confidentiality in transit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+
- Supported OS: Linux, macOS, Windows (Path issues may arise)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:tuxnode/ShareLock.git
cd ShareLock

# Build everything and generate a dev TLS certificate
make all

# Run all tests
make test

# View available targets
make help
```

### Running Tests

The project uses [Ginkgo v2](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) for testing. See the [Testing Guide](./docs/testing.md) for detailed documentation, including [benchmarks](./docs/testing.md#benchmarks).

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run a specific test suite
go test -v -run "TestSetupAndExecution" ./...
```

### Host Management

The client uses `~/.config/sharelock/.hosts` (fallback: `~/.hosts`) to manage KV server connections.

```bash
# Add a KV server host
./sharelock host add default localhost:8080

# Add a plain TCP host (no TLS, for development)
./sharelock host add dev localhost:8080 --tls=false

# Select host via environment variable
SHARELOCK_HOST=dev ./sharelock storefile -filename hello.txt -content "data"

# List configured hosts
./sharelock host list
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Build binaries
make build

# Initialize a user
./sharelock inituser -username alice -password secret

# Store a file
./sharelock storefile -filename hello.txt -content "Hello, World!"

# Load a file
./sharelock loadfile -filename hello.txt

# Share a file
invite=$(./sharelock createinvitation -filename hello.txt -recipient bob)
./sharelock acceptinvitation -sender alice -invitation $invite -filename hello.txt

# Revoke access
./sharelock revokeaccess -filename hello.txt -recipient bob

# Read a file via TLS-encrypted stream
./sharelock read -filename hello.txt -address localhost:8080

# Run the KV Store server (cert generated by make all)
./sharelock-server -address :8080 -dir ./data -cert cert.pem -key key.pem

# Run in plain TCP mode (no TLS, for development)
./sharelock-server -tls=false -address :8080 -dir ./data
```

### Linting

```bash
make vet
```
